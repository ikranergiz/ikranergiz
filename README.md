### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ikra!
#### I'm a computer engineer student who is really into AI :robot:
As a wide part of my graduation project, I've been studying *object detection* and *tracking* in a given image. To inspect deep learning algorithms in the field of computer vision, I've been researching resources and reading articles.

I'm also working on the **AWS Machine Learning Foundations** course on Udacity with the scholarship provided by *Amazon*. 

Skills: Python | Git | C & C++ | AWS Web Services | 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project which makes *human-computer communication* stronger. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TensorFlow and PyTorch. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with object detection especially with YOLO.
